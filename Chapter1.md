## 1.2 Seven fundamentals

#### Use abstracion to simplify

#### Make the common case fast

#### Performance via parallelism

#### Performance via pipelining

#### Performance via prediction

#### Hierarchy of memories

#### Dependability via redundancy

## 1.3 Below the Program

#### Systems software: 
Software that provides services that are commonly useful, including operating systems, compilers, loaders, and assemblers. Runs on the hardware

#### Compiler: 
A program that translates high-level language statements into assembly language statements.

#### Assembly Language 
A symbolic representation of machine instructions.

#### Machine Language
A binary representation of machine instructions.
